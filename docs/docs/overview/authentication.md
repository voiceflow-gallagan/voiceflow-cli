# Authentication

`voiceflow-cli` uses Voiceflow APIs. By default, the tool uses the default configuration that uses the `gcloud` cli. If you want to use another authentication key you can provide a `json` file with the global `--credentials` parameter.

The `voiceflow-cli` source code is open source, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/xavidop/voiceflow-cli) to learn more about the actions the tool performs.
