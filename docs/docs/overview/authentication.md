# Authentication

`voiceflow-cli` uses Voiceflow APIs. To interact with your Vocieflow projects you will need a [Voiceflow API Key](https://docs.voiceflow.com/reference/authentication). You can get your API Key in your Voiceflow project > Integration page. You can pass the API Key to the CLI using the `--voiceflow-api-key` flag or by setting the `VF_API_KEY` environment variable.

The `voiceflow-cli` source code is open source, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/xavidop/voiceflow-cli) to learn more about the actions the tool performs.
