The goal of the Transcripts is to give you and your team an understanding of where your assistant was successful in helping your users, and where it can be improved.

Each transcript provides a turn-by-turn record of each user interaction, what utterances they used, and what intents they hit along the way.

## Reference

The `voiceflow-cli` has a command that allows you to interact with transcripts from your terminal or from your CI pipelines.

To execute a suite, you can run the `voiceflow transcript` command. For the usage, please refer to this [page](/cmd/voiceflow_transcript).
