# Troubleshooting

## Getting support

All users have access to a public Voiceflow Discord server for support and collaboration. Refer to the [links](/links) page for more information.

## Project not found

Make sure that the Voiceflow project exists and is accessible by the user and API Key that is in used corresponds to that project. If the project is not found, the CLI will return an error message.
